Given a demographics table in the following format:

** demographics table schema **

id
name
birthday

you need to return a table that shows a count of each race represented, ordered by the count in descending order as:

** output table schema **

race
count


SELECT race, COUNT(race)
FROM demographics
GROUP BY race
ORDER BY Count(race) desc


SELECT RACE, COUNT(*) AS COUNT
FROM DEMOGRAPHICS
GROUP BY RACE
ORDER BY COUNT DESC;


SELECT
  RACE,
  COUNT(1) AS COUNT
FROM
  DEMOGRAPHICS
GROUP BY
  RACE
ORDER BY
  COUNT DESC
