Given the following table 'decimals':

** decimals table schema **

id
number1
number2
Return a table with two columns (cuberoot, logarithm) where the values in cuberoot are the cube root of those provided in
number1 and the values in logarithm are changed to the natural logarithm of those in number2.


SELECT CBRT(d.number1) AS cuberoot,
       LN(d.number2) AS logarithm
FROM decimals AS d



SELECT
  CBRT(NUMBER1)AS CUBEROOT,
  LN(NUMBER2)AS LOGARITHM
FROM
  DECIMALS


  select ||/number1 as cuberoot, ln(number2) as logarithm from decimals

  select power(number1, (1/3.0)) as cuberoot, ln(number2) as logarithm from decimals
