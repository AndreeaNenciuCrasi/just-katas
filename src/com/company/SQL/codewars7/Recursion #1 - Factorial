##1 - Factorial

In mathematics, the factorial of a non-negative integer n, denoted by n!, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. For example,

5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.

The value of 0! is 1.

#Your task

You have to create the function factorial that receives n and returns n!. You have to use recursion.


WITH RECURSIVE factorial(n, fact) AS (
  VALUES(0::BIGINT, 1::BIGINT)
  UNION ALL
  SELECT n + 1, (n + 1) * fact
  FROM factorial
  WHERE n < 16
)

SELECT *
FROM factorial;
