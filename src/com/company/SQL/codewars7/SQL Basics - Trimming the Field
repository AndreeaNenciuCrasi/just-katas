You have access to a table of monsters as follows:

monsters schema

id
name
legs
arms
characteristics
The monsters in the provided table have too many characteristics, they really only need one each. Your job is to trim the characteristics down so that each monster only has one. If there is only one already, provide that. If there are multiple, provide only the first one (don't leave any commas in there).

You must return a table with the format as follows:

output schema

id
name
characteristic



SELECT id,
       name,
       split_part(characteristics, ',', 1) as characteristic
  FROM monsters
ORDER BY id


SELECT
  id,
  name,
  CASE WHEN characteristics like '%,%'
  THEN left(characteristics,position(',' in characteristics)-1)
  ELSE characteristics END as characteristic
FROM monsters
ORDER BY id


select id, name,  substring(characteristics from '^[^,]+') as characteristic from monsters order by id



SELECT id,
       name,
       regexp_replace(characteristics, ',.*', '') AS characteristic
FROM monsters
ORDER BY id


SELECT id,
       name,
       substring(characteristics, '^[a-z]+') AS characteristic
FROM monsters
ORDER BY id


SELECT
  id
  ,name
  ,SUBSTRING(characteristics,'^\w+') characteristic
FROM monsters
ORDER BY id
